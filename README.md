# Clinic-Appointment-Booking
Booking and scheduling appointments through calls or waiting at the clinic is inefficient and unnecessary, especially in times of pandemic. Booking can be done in a more efficient way using an application. This helps the doctors and the management to schedule appointments and reduce patient waiting time. <br />

In our application, the user can register and login to book appointments. The user can view doctor details and search for the doctors by specialty, name or working time. The user can view their previous appointments along with its details. While booking, the user can choose their preferred timing and mention symptoms for the doctor to refer. The receptionist will confirm or decline the booking and the message will be sent to the user. The user can also view and update their profile information. The user also has the option to cancel their appointment and reschedule. <br />

The main objective of our system is to allow current and future patients to easily make appointments with different doctors of the clinic at all times. <br />
